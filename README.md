#TuneMahViolin

## Description

A minimalistic mobile phone violin tuner (for J2ME enabled mobile phones) using genuine violin sound for easier tuning

## Usage example

If you just want to try, you can find the .jar and .jad files in the "dist" subdirectory

If you want to develop and/or change something, I recommend using the source as a Netbeans 7.0 compatible project, and you will need a mobile platform emulator (as are available from Netbeans J2ME plugin)
